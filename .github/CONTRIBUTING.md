# Contribution Guide

This project welcomes contributions. 

New features should be covered by unit tests and linting.
Including tests increases your chances of getting the PR accepted.
I might merge even if tests are missing, but it will likely take more time. 

Run `composer check` before submitting a pull request and fix what you can there to ensure that the code is up to the standard.
